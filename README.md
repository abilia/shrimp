## Task 1
Solve at home. Make a pull request against this repo.

The data sources are available at `www.my-abilia.se/shrimp` and also as reference in `api` folder.

The new feature is to implement `GET` business card information.
The requirements are to print business cards for `persons`
- That does **not** have the occupation of being a student
- With company placed in `Gothenburg`

A business card should contain their full name, occupation and name of company.

Add an view on navigation for `Task1` that should present

![Task1](/shrimp.png?raw=true "Task1")

There are no restrictions in refactoring the current code, language selections or make further development. As long as it works and you can describe why you did your changes. But, it is only a task to start the discussions, so try not to overthink it.

## Task 2
We solve together.

There will be changed and/or added requirements.
